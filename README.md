# Bounce Game Replica

This project is a replica of the classic Bounce game originally found on Nokia phones. It's implemented using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓) to control the movement of the ball.
- The objective of the game is to navigate the ball through the maze without hitting any obstacles.
- If the ball hits an obstacle, the game ends.

## Code Structure

The main logic of the game is implemented in the `script.js` file. It handles the game mechanics, such as player movement, collision detection, and rendering of the game world.

## Resources

- The game assets (images) are stored in the `assets` folder.
- Images used in the game:
  - `tile.jpg`: Background tile.
  - `popper.png`: Popper obstacle.
  - `deflator.jpeg`: Deflator obstacle.
  - `inflator.png`: Inflator obstacle.
  - `spike.png`: Spike obstacle.

## Credits

This project is created by Sara Khan.
